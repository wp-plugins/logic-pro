== Description ==

Visitor Logic Lite is a powerfully designed WP Plugin that allows the site admin to apply "Logic" to content or media on their website.

1. Display specific widgets on certain pages or posts.
1. Display different widget(s) or content based on the category, page, archive, or a post.
1. Show a special message to first time visitors or after a number of visitor views.
